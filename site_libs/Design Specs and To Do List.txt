Design Specifications:
*Use VHDL
*Multile configurations of RISC-V core (3)
*Create a program to benchmark and test RISC-V cores
*Microcontroller architecture with following features:
 *10 LVDS Full Duplex UARTS
 *TMR
 *GPIO Pins
 *SPI
 *I2C
*PCB that connects to the PolarFire's FMC HPC with the following features:
 *LCD Screen
 *3-Position Toggle Switches
 *Ports for Full-Duplex LVDS UART using the provided FIFOs
 *LEDs and Switches for testing
 *ADC


Things To Do:
Testing SPI, I2C, GPIO, LVDS UART
Finish LVDS UART Design (If it doesnt work)
	FIFO
	LVDS IP cannot pick what port it outputs to.
Full Testing of SPI
I2C Configured to communicate with sensors and Tested
GPIO Input and Output as expected. 
Finish Designing other core implementations
Test Core Implementations for workability
Benchmark core implementations and decide which is best
SoftConsole: Driver modules need to be completed
All driver modules need to be tested
LCD Interface with paddle switch to display sensor information
Assemble PCB

Things Done:
TMR
1 core implementation
	Interface with PCB modified (Solution - MIV_AXI)
UART over microUSB (PuTTY)
SPI Implemented, limited testing
I2C Implemented, Output verified on SDA and SCL pins
GPIO Implemented, limited testing (output)
